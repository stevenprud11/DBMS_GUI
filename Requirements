Need to do:
  Cart Window (Remove from cart, Merge Cart)
    Each item gets its own cart, select books to checkout.
    All books selected will get the Cart_ID changed to the Highest number.
    Add completed date to the cart.
  Account Window (Edit Information?)
  Checkout Button (Marks cart as checked out (Cart Table))
    Has a window for checkout (Billing and Shipping Address (Don't need to save))
    Merging carts will be by allowing users to pick the books they wish to Checkout (Similar to BookSearch, but add to checkout)
    
Note there is only one shipping address and one billing address for each order though the shipping address may 
  not be the same as the billing address. Currently for payment method, it only accepts credit card,
  hence the bookstore needs to record credit card information.
